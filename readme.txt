== Description ==

Opis w jÄ™zyku polskim: http://www.blogworkorange.net/my-email-shortcode/

My Email Shortcode is a plugin which adds a new shortcode [my-email] to your options. You can insert this shortcode at any place in your post or page main body and it will be automatically substituted by a link with your email address.

The shortcode takes the email addres from the post or page author profile, so whenever you change this email, the change will be automatically shown in all your posts and pages.

You can also add a default subject by adding a subject attribute like this: [my-email subject="Subject"]. Whenever a person clicks on your addres, it will autoamtically set the subject of the message to the one you chose.
