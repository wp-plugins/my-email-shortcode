== Description ==

Opis w jÄ™zyku polskim: http://www.blogworkorange.net/my-email-shortcode/

My Email Shortcode is a plugin which adds a new shortcode [my-email] to your options. You can insert this shortcode at any place in your post's or page's main body and it will be automatically substituted by a link with your email address (with anti-spambot protection automatically included).

The shortcode takes the email addres from the post or page author's profile, so whenever an author changes his/her email, the change will be automatically shown in all his/her posts and pages.

You can also add a default subject by adding a subject attribute like this: [my-email subject="Subject"]. Whenever a person clicks on your addres, it will autoamtically set the subject of the message to the one you chose.
